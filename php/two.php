				<b>ABOUT VERVE MEDIA - </b><br>
				Verve media started in 2008  with the idea to develop films that Excite people are timeless and passion driven. and ultimately that influences the viewer. A young team that spends most time discussing ideas; fresh, innovative ideas that force new perspective to film-making be it commercials, branding, documentaries or television; we try hard to keep it simple. Some of us are formally educated and some aren't and we'd like to keep it that way. Again new perspectives matter.

They will document the designs.  From the actual sites and locality of the project on a first hand basis. Verve media will be instrumental in creating a shortfilm advertisement that will be sent to colleges across India and circulated/publicized on a  national level.
